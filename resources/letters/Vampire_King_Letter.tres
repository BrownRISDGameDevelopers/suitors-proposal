As you are no doubt aware, I am entrusted with the exalted duty of presiding over a vast land—-though alas, one regrettably lacking in liveliness. My blessings are bountiful; I am endowed with infinite life, enormous wealth, unquestioned power, and luxuriously soft hair. And yet, I am not content. 

As the season grows warmer and the sun shines ever brighter, I am made increasingly aware of an affliction which so keenly haunts my absent soul. I am, in a word, lonely. This may come as a shock, as my kingdom doth not suffer from a lack of inhabitants. I myself am constantly hounded by supplicants dying to prostrate themselves at my bejeweled feet. Rather, I long for the company of a less…breathless variety. 

Recent immigrants to my realm bring news of your present troubles, and though death is a guest oft entertained in my court, I recognize that for humans, he is not so warmly welcomed. I believe if we were to ally ourselves, my innumerable citizens would not hesitate to aid in your kingdom’s reconstruction. It is for this reason that I wish to extend my deepest condolences and, if Your Highness deems it agreeable, my hand in marriage. As we are the only two monarchies on the continent, I feel it is foolish to remain isolated when we might accomplish much more in union.
