summerVersion = "Bright tidings! I am Ingree Thaldrin. You may recognize my name as the youngest Head Steamwright to earn the title and the first dwarf to utilize mana-powered forges. It may shock you to hear this, but before my success, my peers dismissed me as a “magic-sick radical”! Even now, as my forges run hotter than dragonfire and produce weaponry three times the strength of natural ore, my progress is constantly under siege from the metal purists of the Durvashian Council. 

I write to you today to request an alliance, as you know better than most that if a kingdom cannot evolve, it will calcify like stone and be ground to dust. Now, I know that I do not carry the prestige of the old ways; if you take my hand in marriage, I cannot offer medals or muscle. What I do have is blueprints and a smarter way ahead. 

Durvash can extend to yours the protection of technological prowess manned by a military might unparalleled on the rest of the continent. Nobody can orienteer the intricacies of this better than myself, and as a result, I know that the mana in your land can best amplify our already crushing supply. Such a development would bring about a new era of prosperity—something we must both admit is desperately needed, as you face a looming plague and the Old Dwarven Guard threatens to drag my people back into the past. As you consider my proposal, please remember: “tradition” is merely the word we give to problems we’re too lazy to fix.

P.S. apologies if this letter smells of ozone and lavender—I write this from my lab, and the mana coil is…humming. Rest assured that any kinks will be sorted out in time! "
