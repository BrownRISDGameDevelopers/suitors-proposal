summerVersion = "I apologize for not making your acquaintance sooner. As the commander-in-chief of Gravenmere’s Forgotten Front (though you may simply call me Marrow), it is the work of my undead life to lead my skeletal troops, and the severity of my duty consumes all of my energy. I love my desert kingdom. From the zombies of the Cracking Plains to the bonefolk of the Infinite Catacombs, their eternal happiness is my sole concern. This is why I am writing you now. As you may know, our land is gravely lacking in mana, the lifeforce which fuels our bones and preserves us from rot. Without a proper ally, we will return to the dust from whence we came and never return. 

As for you, I have heard the murmurings of a plague infecting your lands. This poses difficulties for both of us; despite what the other kingdoms whisper, Gravenmere does not wish death upon the Living Lands—we have enough citizens as it is. In death, my people merely covet the power and stability that could not sustain us in life. And Highness, while I cannot offer you green hills rolling with fruit, I can offer you a military might that rivals the dwarves and the sheer manpower of a people desperate for purpose. 

As one final note, I know you may soon be in contact with His Majesty the Eternal King, if you are not already. I love the monarchy, but I must tell you that His Majesty’s softness has obstructed his ability to act conclusively. That is all I will say as I await your response. Until then, good luck.
